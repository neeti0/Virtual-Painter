AI-Virtual-Painter
An AI-based project using the mediapipe and OpenCV libraries to implement real-time hand gesture recognition, allowing users to draw onscreen using 
their index finger.

How to Use:
Use your index and middle finger to activate Selection Mode and choose from various colors or the eraser at the top of the screen.
Selecting3

Adjust the thickness of the draw using the distance between your thumb and index finger, selecting the desired size when the pinky finger is up.
Selecting Thickness

Clear the screen simply by closing your hand.
Cleaning

Enter in Stand by Mode using only your index and pinky finger (indicated by a line between these 2 fingers). This mode is useful when you want to draw separate things on the screen.
